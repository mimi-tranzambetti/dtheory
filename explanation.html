        <p>“Guide for Makers” addresses the difficulty of finding fulfillment in creating projects in a digital space for a designer with a background in hardware. In high school, I’d spent the majority of my free time in the robotics lab, the ceramics room, or the art studio. Having never used Illustrator or InDesign or CAD before coming to college, the transition to graphic design, digital art, and 3D modeling was jarring. I’d entered the 
    
    entrepreneurship community at USC, where the most highly valued projects were all apps. My skills in making felt devalued, and I felt like I had to learn how to use digital tools to find a space in the design community. The tools weren’t intuitive, and even today the interactions through the interfaces are frustrating. The sweet spot that was once so easy to find in my creative endeavors became elusive, and the projects that I was churning out felt too polished and disingenuous. “Guide for Makers” expresses all of these frustrations. The first bit of the manifesto was the part about pinching and zooming — I remember this visceral moment of pure hatred for a really spazzy Illustrator file I was trying to edit a logo in, and I was pinching and zooming but it wouldn’t work — that’s when I realized that interacting with projects through interfaces was the worst part about having to work in a digital space. It is also my personal reminder that it is possible to hit flow state in a digital creative world, as long as I’m mindful of altering my process and taking breaks based on my needs as a maker who’s accustomed to physical projects. <p></p>
“Guide for Makers,” is a handwritten text in a small Moleskine with accompanying illustration and post it flags. The text is meant to be reminiscent of journaling in field guides, to appear as an trustworthy, pocket sized guide for makers navigating a confusing digital space. The handwritten type and illustrations bring honesty to the text, as well as add elements of whimsy and lightness to what reads as an otherwise bleak situation. I try as often as possible to integrate in examples of flow state, in descriptions and in the writing style. The writing style is very much “stream of consciousness” to imitate what writing in “flow state” would sound like. The tone is mildly sardonic and self-aware because it is kind of a hilarious situation - it’s a tone that’s aware of the impossibility of what it’s suggesting. I’ve also integrated a digital component in two versions: one is just the plain text, the other is a digital scan of the physical copy. The first is in case my handwriting isn’t legible, the second is to create an interactive example of the study referenced in the manifesto, where users were presented with both a physical object and its digital counterpart. You may see for yourself which version conveys the manifesto’s meaning more effectively, and which piques your interest more.<p></p><p>
“Guide for Makers’” design is heavily influenced by Aaron Draplin’s Field Notes. I couldn’t get my hands on any Field Notes in time for this particular project, but I’ve used them in the past to scribble down ideas and important quotes to remember — Draplin emphasizes the need to start all design with sketches, and a Field Notes-esque manifesto seemed like the best mediu through which to convey this message. Also a lot of the flow state content was brought in from my Intro to Psychology textbook.
