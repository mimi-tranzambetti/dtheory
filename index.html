  <h1>  A Comparative Study of User Experience between Physical Objects and their Digital Surrogates </h1>
  <h2> There exists four dimensions to an interactions affects on user experience and their corresponding attributes</h2>
</div>

<div class="container"> Questions to be answered:
<p>1. How does the user describe multi-dimensional experiences with physical/digital objects and
what are the differences or similarities?</p>
<p>2. How does the user construct meaningful experiences with physical/digital objects?</p>
<p>3. What specific elements of the physical and digital objects engage the user?</p>
</div>

<div class="container" class="affect">
  <h1> Sensual </h1>
  <h2> Definition <h2>
    <p> The visual and sensorial aspects ot he physical object through touch and can include all five senses </p>
    <h2> Attributes </h2>
    <h3>Aesthetics attributes </h3>
    <p>Affect through visual and tangible experience (manipulation) </p>
    <h3>Novelty & curiosity</h3>
    <p>Unique features and unusual or novel qualities</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container" class="affect">
    <h1> Emotional </h1>
    <i class="material-icons">favorite</i>
    <h2> Definition <h2>
      <p> An emotional effect a user has with the objects </p>
        <h2> Attributes </h2>
      <h3>Inquisitive & Interpretive</h3>
      <p>To provoke analytical thinking or to reflect upon.</p>
      <h3>Emotions & Feelings</h3>
      <p>Real and or imagined emotions (joy, fear, sadness) or feelings (state of mind) such as satisfaction or contentment</p>

        <h3>Connectionss </h3>
        <p>Making connections through memory of experiences. Creating a story or narrative</p>

        <i class="material-icons">explore</i> <i class="material-icons">extension</i>
        <h2> Definition <h2>
          <p> Arousing an epiphanic experience between the user and the object </p>
          <h2> Attributes </h2>
          <h3>Transformation </h3>
          <p>To have a transforming effect such as awe, wonderment (mysterium tremendum) or fascination
          (drawn to or transformative). To awaken one's deep emotions. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
          <h1> Findings </h1>
        <p>  Some insights into the phenomenon of user experience with physical objects and their digital
surrogates were found in this study. Users did not require any special skills in the physical
environment to handle objects, making the connection immediate. This allowed the participants
to freely concentrate on the object, creating a multi-sensory experience. An additional numinous
quality was also experienced with the highly complex physical object. This supports Orr’s
statement that a true numinous experience from a website is difficult because of the barrier
between the user and the interface.25 Some users experienced the desire to create their own
artifacts after handling the highly complex object. This is an example of when object-subject
engagement becomes very real to the user.26 Digital collections required an interface to navigate
through the website. The user’s attention was divided between their visual perception (what the
user was looking at) and moving the mouse up and down to read the content. More time was
spent on digital documentation than the digital image, making the engagement less about the
object and more about the content. Users not only read all of the documentation provided on the
website but some even went outside the website and searched the web. This supports the study
by Dorner, Liew, and Yiu, which states that for users to interpret digital resources, appropriate
context must be provided.27 It bears mentioning that studying digital objects can encourage users
to experience the physical object.</p></div>
