<div class="container" id="introduction"> <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>

In this guide you'll get a glimpse into my personal flow state as well as find tools and tips on how to achieve a flow state in and cope with the digital space.
    </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container" id="flow">
        <h2>1 · Flow makes life worth living</h2>
<p>
Flow is  “a particular kind of experience that is so engrossing and enjoyable that it is worth doing for its own sake even though it may have no consequence outside itself" (Jackson 1999). Flow is an optimal experience in which the activity is completely absorbing and satisfying. The person experiencing flow loses track of time, forgets about his or her problems, and fails to notice other things going on (Gazzaniga 2016). Flow experiences have been reported during playing music, Tetris, sports, or simply doing a satisfying job. Flow experiences bring personal fulfillment and make life worth living (Csikszentmihalyi 1990). 
</p>
<p>
For me, flow state is making. More specifically, that’s painting, drawing, ceramics, woodworking, building robots... There's something so therapeutic about seeing your project come to life as you're creating it. 
</p>
<p>
Getting lost in the feeling of the bristles passing over the gridded white background, paint appearing on the canvas with each brush stroke, the hint of a portrait discernable in the motion of the lines
</p>
<p>
Hearing the belt sander grind away at a sharp corner, sawdust flying off the belt and settling on the sleeves of your shirt, a rounded corner slowly taking shape and suddenly - it's a smooth edge, a perfect curve. 
</p>
<p>
Seeing the needle dip into the coarse muslin, in, out, in, out, the tip reappearing, tugging the thread away from yourself, and there it is, a perfect seam. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Nothing compares to the realness and truth of that material interaction.</strong>
</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container" id="impasse">
        <h2>2 · I’ve lately found myself at an impasse</h2>
<p>

If flow state makes life worth living, then how am I supposed to continue enjoying life as a maker if I cannot achieve flow state in a society that demands we create in a digital space? Digital projects should be intentional in creating a tangible component to increase engagement in their user.
</p>
<p>
And it's not just me - it has been shown that physical objects elicit more emotional and serendipitous reactions than digital objects, and can more readily pique a user's intrigue.  With the increase in digitally archived library documents, researchers are asking themselves what users might be losing in sensory and emotional experience at the digital level.
</p>
<p>
A study conducted at Simmons College found that certain physical elements do not translate well to the digital environment: depth, size, texture, and interactive complexities—“intrinsic information that could provide additional knowledge about the creator's meaning and intent or purpose of construction.” “Users experienced a high level of engagement with the complex physical objects," and “numinous qualities were experienced only at the physical level.” (Varnalis-Weigle 2016) 
</p>
<p>
The digital revolution isn't news - the world's rapid digitalization and subsequent globalization will continue to speed up in the years to come. More and more, information is being transmitted digitally as blocks of data, and we're receiving massive amounts of information everywhere we turn and on our devices. It's an ever present goal of companies to keep their users 'engaged' on social media, through TV ads, and sprawling billboards that scream "buy me!”. Advertisement and the dissemination of information have created a constant stream of overstimulation that has become the basis of today's global economy.
</p>
<p>
 It is reasonable to assume that to lead a satisfactory life with a decent standard of living, an individual must find a way to contribute to the capitalist society. But to be a hardware maker in a society that values digital experiences above all — I present you with my dilemna.
</p>
    </div>

        <h2>3 · Just transfer your love of making to a digital space you say -</h2>
        <p>If only it were so simple - to me, working through a digital interface feels obstructive to my workflow. Digital interfaces are infuriatingly poor imitations of physical making processes, and create products lack sincerity.
</p>
<p>
Imagine that you have a 3D model of an intricate box, and you want to carve a shelf out of one of the faces. To turn the box you have to hold down the mouse with one finger while swiping your index finger horizontally across the trackpad. To get close to the detail on the carving you spread your forefingers apart on the trackpad and suddenly the model is larger on the screen. 
</p>
<p>
Each little pause in your build is a little annoyance, a little break in the work flow. If I were to be working with the shelf as a physical project, I wouldn't have to deal with nonsensical interactions, I could just manipulate my project directly, picking it up to turn and bringing it closer to inspect. We cannot be expected to achieve flow state if our flow is constantly interrupted by an unwieldy layer of abstraction. 
</p>
<p>
Piling onto my grievances about digital interfaces, dragging a couple of pixels farther right or left on a drawing tablet is so dissatisfying. Nothing can replace the scratch of pencil on paper, your head bowed over your art instead of poring into a screen, or the eraser shavings bordering the page of a finished drawing.
</p>
<p>
The end result to these processes may be clean and to the point, but make me feel something, dammit. Beautiful pitch decks with vectorized icons and sleek graphs, followed by a promotional video that's supposed to tug at my heartstrings... are you engaged yet? I’m not! Give me something to touch, something for my hands to do, I'm desperate.

    <h2>4 · Digging around for an answer</h2>
<p>
But our ever rapid propulsion into a digital space is inevitable, and our romantic ideal to uphold physical projects as equal to digital projects is quickly shattered. 
</p>
<p>
The answer for those obsessed with the physical realm is to embrace the digital space, admire its effortless precision and speed, but to remember that each digital project can and should stay grounded in some tangible component. 
</p>
<p>
The middle ground to be acknowledged exists in tools such as laser cutting and augmented reality, which have brought the best of the digital realm into the physical and vice versa. 
</p>
<p>
We must not lose the possibility of evoking a numinous realization from the explorer examining the object, and that exploratory component of learning must be preserved. Don’t give up on physical projects. 
    </p>
    <p>I won’t. </p>

    <div class="container" id="tips">
        <h2>Tools and Tips </h2>
<p>
Finding fulfillment and staying engaged in the digital space is difficult. Here are some of my personal favorite tips. Keep adding tips & tricks that work for you.
    
</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" id="tip1">

<h2>Tip 1: Get physical while prototyping </h2>

<p>
Don't go immediately to digital. keep sketching, keep pushing your design, and when you think it's ready, mock it up with some cardboard and sharpies. Only move to CAD once the majority of the kinks in your design have been ironed out. If anyone tells you that 3D printing was made to mock things up quickly physically, tell them that 3D printing may be fast, but nothing is faster than a determined maker with a box cutter and hot glue. Having to deal with CAD software won't interfere nearly as much with your flow if it's at the tail end of the process. Think of it as filling out paperwork after a long day of work in the field. 
</p>
</div>
    <div class="container" id="tip2">
<h2>Tip 2: Dump the gunk </h2> 
        

<p>
The more time we spend staring at computers, the more gunk accumulates in our brains, slowing us down and dimming our perception of our natural surroundings. Every day set aside time to experience the great outdoors (if there are no great outdoors at your disposal, go out into the bustling streets of Los Angeles and feel your lungs expand with exhaust fumes and feel alive - hey, at least you're not breathing in digital doom.) Meditating works pretty well too.
</p>
        </div>
    <div class="container" id="tip3">

<h2>Tip 3: Laugh a little </h2>
        

<p>
Annoyed that the pinch and zoom interaction makes no sense? Bring your fingers together, “pinch and zoom” in real life and chuckle that everyone who's modeling the case to the next Apple Watch right now has to pinch and zoom because they're stuck on a pixelated 2D plane. The absurdity of digital interactions has been an infallible source of amusement to me. And then cry, because you realize your magazine spread is due tomorrow and nothing is more annoying than having to navigate through inDesign. 
</p>
        </div>
    <div class="container" id="tip4">

<h2>Tip 4: Remind yourself, and others, that what you are creating in important </h2>
<p>
This is my reminder. What's yours? And please, don't have it be another iPhone or another ZARA blazer. There’s a difference between thoughtful craftsmanship and consumer objects destined for obsolescence. If we spent more time in a physical space we'd be more in tune with how much waste fills our lives. Imagine a world where we we spend less time hearing our phones tell us we want more and more time wanting less in our closets.
</p>
<p>
<strong>That’s it from me. Stay true to your roots and good luck on your own adventure! </strong>
