  <h1> Digital </h1>
  <p> There is nothing on the page. </p>
  <p> How can we solve tangible problems around our own community
  if we choose to stay placeless and disconnected in the digital realm.</p>
  <p> as I build this website I think of how little of my own personality is imbued
    into this interaction. when I crinkle a page, is it rough? do I fold it back gently?
    Do I rip the page out? There are no constraints beyond the binding of the book.
    Digital gives you little choice - ah. this is what it looks like when you hover
    over a link. I guess you can choose how quickly and smoothly you scroll down a page
    but there is so little variability. your computer has your mouse set on a certain speed
    you scroll set to a certain speed, and if you must ask the computer.</p>
    <p>Digital cramps my style.</p>
    <p>Digital is placeless.</p>
    <p>Digital is trendy.</p>
    <p>In digital you can be specific but you have to work so hard to create a semblance
      of variability and randomness. Everythign is geared towards organization. Maybe, maybe then
      the answer is not in going just back to physical, but embracing
